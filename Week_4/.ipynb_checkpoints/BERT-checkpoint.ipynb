      "Hi I have a little  Subaru Legacy that I absolutely love but it s run into a few problems one of them being the air flow inside the car In the two years I ve had it the air conditioning was very poor but the heat worked perfectly Today however both stopped working completely For extra info my Subaru has 194 000 miles on it and the clutch and radiator were replaced within the last year I also noticed that right before my radiator blew in part due to errors from a mechanic while replacing the clutch very little air came from the vents and it was not at the correct temperature I set it to This may or may not be related but in the past when it has been very hot in the summer my car has started to shake violently when coming down from a high speed and then stalls this hasn t happened in awhile but used to occur frequently in hot weather No mechanic was ever able to determine why that happened I added that it s a 2 5 GT model I m not exactly sure what that means but I do know a mechanic who worked on it didn t realize this car was a different and apparently less common model than other Subaru Legacies he d worked on so he made errors and I got 2000 of free labor on an originally small repair A last note the previous owner was not too kind to this car and one of many decisions he made was to disengage the check engine lights on the dash so technically I don t know if that information could have helped me understand the problem as I can t see them If you have any ideas or advice about what is wrong or how to fix this please let me know \n",

      " Buick Park Avenue 3 8 Liters Not Ultra My car overheated because the Thermostat failed Can you answer some questions When I was young Thermostats failed in the open position thus the engine would run cold which while not ideal poses no danger to the engine Now Thermostats fail in the closed position so the engine will overheat which puts the engine at risk for damage Why are Thermostats made to put engines at risk Seems like it would increase costs for consumers to repair The overheating caused one of two plastic bypass pipes to split They have been replaced with aluminum pipes What is now the weak point s The engine was hot at 268 it would die but would restart What made the engine quit What allowed the engine to restart Note I did mange to drive to my mechanic a distance of 3 3 miles My mechanic was concerned about the engine but it was OK My brother says using Marvel Mystery oil helps protect engine at high heat any info on this \n",

      "Just my  cents but that little wheel won t create much boost unless it s really spinning That s one reason why little or no boost during easy driving When I worked for SAAB part of the PDI and every 30k miles a boost pressure test was required The red green gauge on the dash was not sufficient so a vacuum gauge had to mounted on the dash and plumbed in The process was lengthy so I won t go into it but boost only occurred when the foot was moderately planted and it came on gradually SAAB at one time used an adjustable waste gate which caused problems due to owners messing with it and blowing head gaskets or pulling head bolts out of the engine block They got around this by using an electric overboost switch which detected too much boost and cut off the fuel pump temporarily The waste gate is set for a certain PSI and only opens to prevent overboost Many turbo and supercharger systems also use a bypass valve which allows naturally aspirated operation until the foot is planted Ford GM etc use or used a vacuum pod which holds a flap closed until the foot is planted Manifold vacuum goes away upper intake vacuum takes over and pulls the bypass flap closed and boost is created Back off the throttle spring closes flap back to natural breathing This is kind of what the bypass valve GM looks like and the pic below it can be seen on a Ford \n",

      "My  Colorado 4 cylinder has been plagued with similar issues When the truck was in New Mexico for a number of years it would only happen if I had not driven it for a while months and then drove a short trip So my thought was moisture I drove the truck back east and it has happened more frequently Like Carmen above it happens in groups So maybe a dozen times this summer The common threads are If you let it sit for 15 minutes it starts normally no blue smoke no gas smell no roughness and no delay Just like when the condition is not happening Turn the key one revolution and it starts It typically happens when you start normally go for a 3 to 10 mile journey shut it off then try to restart after 10 15 minutes If I go farther then all is well If I try to start it when the condition is happening the thing just spins over without ever a sputter If I wait 10 minutes it just spins over without a sputter If I wait 15 minutes it starts on the first revolution no smoke no gas smell no rough running It seems to happen the same whether it is raining or dry and sun shining the weather has turned a little cooler so I have not seen it for a couple of weeks I read somewhere that you should wait for 5 or 10 seconds with the key on before starting I tried it a number of times no effect My mechanic has searched his database of weird things and nothing My guess is that it is starved of gas since there is no smell or rough idle I am also guessing that it is not just a pump issue since when it starts it is immediate Maybe a temperature sensitive computer control on the injectors \n",

      "My  Hyundai Santa Fe with only 64 000 miles recently developed an issue with the fuel gauge After filling the tank I soon noticed that my fuel gauge registered nearly empty after driving only 15 miles or so A few days and several miles later the fuel gauge still registered empty I thought perhaps I had a fuel leak so I topped it off and the needle moved to a quarter tank After some research I found that this fuel gauge issue is common with the Santa Fe and replacement of the two fuel sending units could cost upwards of 500 Undaunted I thought I would try to fix the problem by disconnecting a battery terminal and then reconnecting it shortly thereafter I thought perhaps rebooting the onboard computer might correct my problem Well it worked The gauge registered correctly for about a month Then the gauge began to malfunction again So I once again disconnected the battery and the problem was instantly corrected What s going on here \n",

      "My  mustang v6 has an intermittent overheating problem I say intermittent because the car will sometimes start overheating after just 10 minutes of driving and other times can go 30 minutes and the temperature gauge stays right in the middle Speed i m going doesn t seem to effect the overheating it has begun to overheat going at highway speeds and also at slower speeds and idle Also sometimes the car temperature gauge will show it s running hot and then keep going up to the point where i have to pull over or else the car would overheat And sometimes it will go up just a little past half but then go back down And sometimes i can drive long distances and it won t go past half at all It s very strange Also today the temp gauge went about 3 4 up to the red zone and i pulled over and shut the engine off then i turned the car to accessory mode within 10 seconds of pulling over and the temperature gauge showed half I turned on the engine again just to make sure and the gauge was back at half even though it had been at 3 4 only a few seconds ago from what ive read this sounds like a sensor is giving false temp gauge readings but i did a bit of research and apparently a  mustang doesn t have a coolant temperature sensor only has a cylinder head temperature sensor idk if this is the same part with a different name or if it does the same thing as a coolant temp sensor What could be the issue The car doesn t have any coolant leaks I ve also replaced the thermostat and bled the system so i m sure there s no air trapped inside I m really thinking it s a sensor since the car overheated and then according to the temperature gauge cooled down to normal temp within a few seconds But which sensor would this be Thanks \n",

      "Dear Car Talk Community push button start problem I own a  Honda Accord with the same problem as the reader that was published in our daily paper Unfortunately my car did not start at all when I pushed the start button The brake pedal did not engage at all The AAA club gave me a jump start and said I must have left the lights on or door open not so This happened 3 more times The final time I bought a new battery at my own expense dealer was closed on Sunday The next day the car would not start and my Honda dealer sent a tow truck to pick up the car after waiting 4 hours The Honda service dept kept it for 5 days and gave me a Honda Accord 2015 loaner car The service department said every morning they started the car and it worked correctly and no problems were happening at the car dealer I asked the service dept if they put my car on lift to check underneath the car and they said no they did not also the mechanics told me my problem was rare and they had no record of other customers having this problem The car dealer NEVER mentioned that there was a official HONDA SERVICE bulletin about this subject I returned my loaner car and picked up my  Honda Accord and so far it has started every day for the last 2 weeks However it still makes a growling sound when I start it up and turn it off The 2015 Honda Accord I had from car dealer did not make this sound I am requesting that you provide me with the exact number of the HONDA SERVICE bulletin so I can show it to my mechanic at the Honda dealer for the work that is required to fix my car at NO charge because it is covered under my Honda warranty Thank you for this wonderful community of car lovers and the best place on the world wide web to get your car problem questions answered In addition is there a website that is open to the public that I can look at and download a copy of the HONDA SERVICE bulletin on this subject THANK YOU and HAPPY NEW YEAR to everyone in the CAR TALK website discussion of all general topics \n",

      "Thank you  and Volvo V70 for your prompt responses to my question Unfortunately I did not need help in reading I understand what my owner s manual and maintenance guides say neither says whichever comes first by the way but those guides are specifically based on driving a certain number of miles per year In fact the manuals therefore call for oil changes every 4 6 months My type of driving with the Lexus RX 300 actually says change oil every 7 500 miles but I have followed a 5 000 mile schedule to coincide with other scheduled maintenance services I go back to the dealer and have followed their instructions faithfully Not once in the 17 years I have owned this great and reliable vehicle has any Lexus mechanic suggested I should follow a different schedule even though the manuals say change oil every 4 6 months that s the or category For nearly the entire time of my ownership oil changes have been more or less annually My question which I have now researched in more productive forums is what is the problem with following the mileage guidance instead of the time guidance Foods and medicines and even oil have best by dates but often can be used after those dates The importance of the date depends upon the product s effective life Mileage identifies oil usage so the deterioration to be expected there is obvious But what deterioration occurs sitting in a garage That was my question I have seen answers pertaining to accumulated water vapor and carbon buildup but I m not entirely convinced yet Still it s been a year with just 3 500 miles so I will probably go with caution this time Speaking to you Volvo 70 you might want to consider Car Talk s guidelines for responses and drop the snarkiness It s just a turn off on an otherwise useless response \n",

      "Since the vehicle is a  or 19 years old and One side was very hot and the other not I don t believe that it is air in the system The heat from the passenger side is that the brakes were staying ON the fluid than gets hot and starts boiling which becomes a VAPOR in the lines and your brakes become soft and spongy and do not work Brake fluid absorbs water moisture from the air and becomes diluted and the boiling temp becomes lowered quite a bit You should probably have the brake fluid changed out However WHY did the one side become so Hot and start interfering with your brakes This could very well be caused by the age of your brake hose lines The brake HOSE going to the caliper is subject to deterioration and can get to the point where when you release the brakes take your foot of the pedal the brake hose COLLAPSES or PINCHES and the brake fluid is NOT released from the Caliper This causes the brake to stay ON and it becomes very HOT which causes the fluid to boil which causes you to lose your brakes When you apply the brakes the hose is FILLED with fluid pressurized and moves the caliper and the brake hose is EXPANDED and when you release the brakes the deteriorated hose COLLAPSES just a bit and causes a pinch and fluid is not released and you get the situation you are describing I suggest you replace both caliper brake hoses and any brake HOSE not steel tubing in the same vicinity on both sides of your brakes get the fluid flushed and you will probably be fine after that I apologize if this is not it I did not read all the previous comments but this specific incident did happen to me on a 1992 truck that I own If this does not fix it you should definitely take it to a good mechanic But a simple deterioration of the brake hose can cause the pedal to sink to the floor because the hose pinches when the pedal is released the brake fluid becomes hot and starts to boil and now you have VAPOR and not fluid in your brake line And Vapor compresses while fluid does not And when it cools it becomes a fluid again \n",

      "So I have a very annoying vibration in a  Ford F150 FX4 5 4L w approx 122k miles This rear end vibration became noticeable about a year ago when I put a new set of tires on And just for the record this vibration was never a problem beforehand So it should be obvious that I have bad tires right Thus I instantly go back to tire dealer and explain the situation They took it apart and checked balancing on all tires and confirmed that they were fine So after dealing w it for a few weeks and rotating the tires around a few times and experimenting with pressures nothing worked So I went back again and asked for more help This time we noticed the U joints were now loose on the driveshaft which we then replaced But this didn t fix the issue I then took it to a separate Ford dealer to have the tires road force tested which nothing found I then had Ford dealer try to diagnose the issue with several trips back and forth with their apparent best people on it I went on numerous test drives explaining the issue The vibration only seems to be noticeable on road and with speed Not in the shop in the air It seems to be pinpoint approx 50 55mph and minimal at lower speeds Also seems to get worse with turns and bumps in the road You can literally watch the bed of the truck vibrate in the mirrors also seems to be more on drivers side It doesn t affect the steering or anything in front of vehicle So Ford also had me come back another time to use a special vibration analyzer on it which still found nothing They checked ball joints suspension you name it The only fix they could recommend was a new driveshaft which I regretfully accepted the challenge and now it s sitting in my garage It didn t help I ended up taking my original shaft to a balancing shop and they found no issues with it Also looked at front 4x4 shaft however it doesn t engage with normal driving 4x2 so shouldn t be the cause Approx 6 months later I went back to same tire shop and had them exchange tires with a completely different set factory recommended size LT275 65 18 thinking it still had to be the tires no fix So then on to other things I started with changing out the rear differential fluid no fix I also put on new rear brakes and rotors no fix I put on new rear shocks no fix I also took off the parking brakes and inspected all cables and housing which could apparently stick sometimes no fix I cleaned all contact areas of wheels and rotors onto the wheel studs to be sure there were no abnormalities no fix I even took off the front 2 leveling kit and tried driving without no fix But this was never a problem before Keep thinking it could be something more deep in the rear differential but most reports say it would be very rough and noisy grinding which it isn t So after probably 6 7 trips to at least 3 4 shops and perhaps 600 later I now have newer tires and a spare d shaft which Ford won t take back by the way and I still have the vibration Any help and or advice would be greatly appreciated Thanks in advance Scott \n",

      "Welcome to the forum I believe you have the system where you turn a dial type knob to access  4L and 2H yes Assuming you just said yes this is what may have happened or is still happening Sometimes the system does not fully switch the xfer case into the range mode you or someone else prior had selected they may not have switched it properly or some such issue occurs and is never sorted out Sometimes the xfer case gets sort of stuck in between modes or the encoder does not know which mode it is in currently I would do this just to see where things stand and to see if it responds correctly to your inputs That knob is not supposed to be turned until you are in Neutral not sure if you are aware of that but that IS the case here So start her up drive to a suitable spot that will allow you to move the vehicle dirt road is actually preferrable here as you cannot engage 4L and turn the front wheels unless you are on a very slippy surface so if on tarmac do NOT turn your front wheels left and right at all Drive to a spot like an empty lot or what have you Go into neutral and select  move the vehicle forward n backward stop Neutral again and try for 4L move forward n back then stop Neutral and then go backward towards 2H again by going into  again using neutral each time and then go into 2H neutral whenever you touch that knob remember and then drive around normally Did the xfer case do as it was told so far as you can tell Hopefully it did now you just need to see what happens driving in 2H without messing with the knob again What you would have accomplished with this little test is to have walked your xfer case through all of its operational ranges in the correct way This was not only to see if it could do it but to also make it go from 2H all the way through every option and back home to 2H again 9basically trying to positively engage its home position in 2H after being in all other modes If the case was not fully in its home position before hopefully it is now See what you get and report back I d stay in 2WD and drive normally hopefully it does not do what it did prior like selecting  or L without you asking the way that can happen is if the case is not positively shifted or the encoder doesnt park the xfer case shifter exactly where it should be its adjustable btw Turning the key and no start sometimes Look at your dash when this is happening do you notice a security or alarm icon illuminated It may be doing this no start on purpose If you have another key use the other key when it is difficult to start or just begin to pay attention to which key you are using at all times and see if the no starts are only associated with one key over the other This is to suss out any security issues with the key and its chip itself No ventilation fan action I dont know if that motor is fused via the fuse panel usually its fused by something called a fuseable link but you can look into that possibility see if it is fused in the normal fuse panels and check the fuse condition I think its fused via F Links however If it is not fused traditionally just move forward and unplug the blower motor Using a digital volt meter measure voltage at the plug when you turn the switch on cycle thru all speeds and measure see what you get If you have power at the plug then its the blower motor itself if you do not have power it can be the motor speed switch the fuseable links that protect the motor or the blower motor resistor which gives you the motor speeds You need to do a little troubleshooting It shouldn t be difficult to locate and remove the blower motor it is in the passenger side down by the foot well usually behind the glove box which you can open all the way to access the motor Sometimes turning the motor by hand frees it up and makes it work again and or it lets you see the condition of the motor a bit by testing how it spins freely or not That s about it Sorry to you and all for writing you a book here \n",

      "Hi people I have a  2wd 4 3 Sonoma I was driving yesterday when my rpms shot up to around 1500 Looked down and saw my temp gauge was pretty high Probably around 240 My AC was on but the fans were not on at all It was around 100 degrees out when this happened The coolant levels are fine I ve had a transmission line pop out of my radiator twice in the last couple months I m pretty sure the clip holding it in was a bit stretched and I think I fixed it the second time putting it back in The transmission fluid was a couple quarts low when my truck overheated yesterday Well today I was trying to see if I could get my truck to overheat in my garage which was 95 degrees I couldn t get it passed maybe 205 even when revving the engine and running the A full blast When I was done I noticed black sludge on the floor under the engine It looks like oily charcoal I just changed my oil Does any one have any idea what that could be Might it just be sludge melting off the engine Thanks for any input \n",

      " to the previous comments All too often people buy a used car that did not come with maintenance records and wind up buying a vehicle that has seen little or no maintenance Or some folks might buy a new car and then proceed to ignore vital maintenance The end result is the same in both cases namely a drastically shortened life span and or high repair costs for the vehicle And then to make matters worse many of these negligent people automatically assume that the problem lies with the automotive manufacturer rather than with themselves Think of it like human longevity As the availability of vaccines life saving medicines and advanced surgical techniques have improved so has the average life span However if someone smokes is a couch potato and fails to seek medical treatment he may wind up living only as long as folks from earlier in the century Ergo with your car and with your own body it is necessary to periodically take steps to ensure long term well being This particular Elantra has not been maintained properly and the OP is now paying the price literally for that lax maintenance \n",

      "I have a  mustang that was overheating I say WAS because the old engine had overheated one too many times and lost compression in 2 cylinders I just replaced the engine with a low mileage one however the car still runs hot Car just had a tested engine with 60k on it put in So the possibility of a blown head gasket can be out ruled oil and coolant levels are good the 60k engine had a brand new water pump 180 degree thermostat this is colder than the 192 degree oem one and coolant temperature sensor put on it before the engine itself was installed Radiator has been flushed and cooling system has been bled properly Looked under the hood while the car was running while in park and the coolant fans turn on and off automatically a few minutes after the car has reached operating temperature which indicates that the fan switch and relay are working properly right Someone please confirm this statement is correct With all the above being considered what could possibly be the reason the car is still running warm As soon as the temp gauge starts going noticeably past the middle I shut the car off so i m not sure if the car would overheat if I allowed it to continue running but I don t want to find out and ruin my brand new engine I just paid for So I have to assume the car is overheating because that s not a risk I m willing to take The following are my only hunches as to what could possibly be causing the car to run hot Any input is appreciated 1 A clogged heater core car heat only works sometimes seemingly completely randomly as in it works some days and other days it blows cold air instead I m not even sure if a clogged heater core could cause overheating I have read very mixed answers online about that could someone also please clarify this 2 A bad radiator Visually inspecting the current one it does have some bent fins and black stuff in some of the vents from visually inspecting it and generally looks dirty and not the silver metallic color a new one would be HOWEVER the mechanic said he flushed and tested it and the radiator to him appeared to have enough flow It is possible he made a mistake here though Please anyone offer their input or thoughts Thanks \n",

      "Hi all I bought an  Civic Hybrid back in 2016 for 3300 with just under 60k miles I got it from an elderly woman who regularly maintained it and kept it in good condition After about 5k miles of usage and an oil change I began noticing rumbling during takeoff and a rare hesitation and jerk during coasting Now I know this problem is called juddering I was only 18 at this point and didn t know the first thing about transmission problems and I was told read that this problem is normal for a CVT hybrid so I ignored it I also did not know that you were supposed to regularly change the transmission fluid Whoops Long story short I am at about 97k miles on this car and it is in otherwise amazing condition but when I just took it into a shop to get a transmission flush the mechanic told me to start looking for a new car because my clutch was burning up This was after a free inspection and not from a super reputable mechanic so I wanted another opinion I ve read countless stories of people fixing this exact issue by burnishing the clutch and then drain filling it a few times My question is whether this is risky to do because changing the old gritty fluid that the transmission is used to can cause the clutch to stop engaging and potentially clot or if I should take the risk and potentially save my CVT I love this car and like I said it still performs well I d love to take it past 100k if I can and at this point the blue book value of this car is only about 1k so not worth expensive repairs Should I do the burnish drain fill \n",

      " 1950 324 KB 1 Introduction Overheating is a very common problem that some drivers encounter while they are driving their vehicles Most cars coolant system fails at some point which will cause overheating problems Modern cars have a sturdy coolant system to prevent overheating problems However Mercedes cars 2015 and newer still have overheating problems and their coolant system is more complicated than other cars There are many causes of overheating problems coolant level is low fans do not work properly at every speed coolant leak exists air in the coolant system radiator cap is bad thermostat is bad water pump doesn t pressurize coolant properly head gasket is blown and more Diagnostic of overheating problems can be performed easily on cars In contrast on Mercedes cars it s hard to diagnose the problem because sometimes an overheating sign cannot be found and the car runs good but it still overheats 2 Learning about the causes of overheating problems For the Mercedes Benz cars there are three major causes of overheating thermostat failure radiator fan failure and coolant leakage in hoses radiator or the water pump The thermostat also considered as the watchdog of the cooling system has two failure scenarios getting stuck in an open position and getting stuck in the closed position Radiator fans failure could be associated with their electric motor failure The main indicator of failure in radiator fans is failure of the fans to come on The other indicator of a failed fan is a blown fuse of the cooling fan circuit within the cooling system can lead to overheating of the engine The upper and lower hoses in the radiator plays a big role in the circulation of coolant within the engine block Leakages within the transmission line lowers the amount of coolant within the system thus reducing the effectiveness of cooling system 3 The danger of overheating Over the last 4 years there has been a rise of the reported cases of fire associated with Mercedes cars overheating The problem has been associated with the starter components The problem is vast in cars manufactured between 2014 and 2017 As of March 2017 there had been 51 cases of fires in Mercedes cars due to overheating in United Kingdom Around the same time the number of fire cases reported was 30 in the US The fire outbreak led to the recalling back of hundreds of thousands of vehicles from the market Recalling such a high number of cars is a clear indicator of how the overheating issue is a big problem in the Mercedes cars cooling system and the whole design perhaps 4 The solution For the Mercedes company to maintain its prestigious name of offering the best cars globally there is a need to address the overheating issue The company might be working towards solving this specific problem but more needs to be done regarding the overall cooling system of the Mercedes cars The repairs of any problem in the cooling system is very high to be ignored The solution is exploring the possibility of redesigning the cooling system of the Mercedes cars taking into consideration all the issues that are pertinent to the problem The redesigning should work towards providing a lasting solution to the problem that is now a major concern The solution should look at both the design of flow and the quality of materials used in the system Solving the overheating problems and costs will not only benefit the end users but also the company s image and reputation It will also help prevents financial losses due to recalling back vehicles due to overheating \n",

      "Maybe you can find a  2016 Edge Titanium or Sport model with 2WD and without the moon roof Both are extra cost options If you don t know about the handling you probably haven t test driven one yet Test drive both the 4Runner and Edge to see if you like either I m sure you can find one that is just about what you want You can test anything to see if it is right for you If you want a 2WD Titanium just find one for a test drive If you don t like it you can look for something else Consumer Reports said that they don t see the need for vehicle certification A nearly new vehicle should be in good shape anyway If you want low mileage you may have to get a CPO since most dealers put the lowest mileage vehicles in the plan Also expect to look at off lease vehicles exclusively for low mileage late model cars I wouldn t worry about that Just focus on the condition of the one you are interested in You could spend about 125 to have your favorite mechanic do a prepurchase inspection You might consider this your equivalent of the CPO check \n",

      "So I made an account just to reply to this post cause I think this is very useful information so I own a  ford ranger and my ac only worked on max power I then replaced the resistor and my ac started working just like new again the resistor does exactly what the name suggests it resists power coming to the blower motor which changes the speed of air blowing through your ac In my truck it goes low medium high and max Also my ac only worked on max because the resistor has a failsafe on it which if the module breaks or fails then the batter then sends power directly to the blower motor which is why there s a max option and why it worked and all other ranges didn t Now just recently I would go outside and turn my truck on and it wouldn t turn the starter motor aka the engine wouldn t start but all my electronics would turn on including my ac and when I d look at the battery gauge it would read at 1 4 battery power and when I d look at the ac control it d be on high not max Now I don t believe my battery was draining while it was off what I think is happening and could be the reason to this old wives tale is that when I would park my truck with the ac on and specifically on the high setting I m unsure if the other modes apply yet and I doubt the max setting affects this at all that puts an excess load on your battery sure if the alternator is on it s trying to charge the battery back up but since you have something resisting current you re technically still lowering the volts being recovered so when you shut the vehicle off you already killed it from turning on again I doubt this is an issue with new models of cars due to technological advances and less power needed to crank an engine So I hope my story can help somebody out there there s always a method to the madness \n",

      " I do not see how Ford can deny warranty coverage and claim that the vehicle was driven with little to no oil in the engine based on an oil change invoice showing 5 quarts rather than the recommended 6 quarts Unless the truck was towed to their shop with little to no oil in the engine Its not from 5v6 but simple oil starvation Because from their perspective that s the most likely scenario And I suspect that s what happened The first shop tried to cover up their mistake It s a little cofusing as written but they had it first Its reasonable to assume they found it empty realized their mistake tried filling and running it Discovered it was shot and then proclaimed they didn t know what was wrong Gets to Ford dealer now has oil but damage done Stick a fork in it davidryanwalker Got car towed back to shop that evening they were closed when I broke down The next morning the tech took the truck into the engine bay but they were unable to give me any solid answers Same day had truck towed to Ford they hook up the diagnostic machine and it gave them 3 codes as the result \n",

      "I have a  mustang v6 that runs slightly warm at highway speeds only especially at higher speeds of 70 mph or more I can idle the car for a long time or drive at city speeds and the temperature gauge stays right in the middle However when I start going faster at 70 80 mph or more after a while the temperature gauge will start creeping up but not overheat When I notice it getting warmer I slow down slightly to 60 mph it will gradually go back to normal temperature in the middle but hypothetically if I were to keep going at a faster speed and not slow down it might keep getting hotter and overheat I haven t tried testing this as I don t want to find out because I slow down everytime I notice it getting hotter and haven t tried not slowing down to see what happens The heat and AC in my car work fine and I can idle city drive with AC or heat on with no problems Only when i m going 70 mph or more does the temperature start increasing and running warm What could the issue be I ve tried basic stuff such as making sure the oil is good checking the coolant level to ensure proper amount is in the radiator and replacing the radiator cap I also did a radiator drain and fill and added radiator flush And drove around for 30 min before doing the drain and fill All those checked out What could the problem be If the radiator was clogged wouldn t it be more likely to overheat at lower speeds since the air flow at lower speeds isn t as strong If it was a water pump issue wouldn t the car would overheat all the time and not just at higher speeds Also the temperature wouldn t fluctuate and go back down it would just overheat completely I m at a loss It could be the thermostat but this seems unlikely because then the car would probably run warm at lower speeds too and likely overheat completely as well If the gauge itself was broken it would be sporadically reading all the time because the car is definitely running hotter at faster speeds but the gauge doesn t move when city driving at slower speeds What could the problem be Thanks \n",

      "You are going to have to give us more than  seconds and you are going to have to record the sound through a bunch of different conditions I suggest that you find a large empty parking lot at least one with a large unoccupied area school parking lots would probbly be OK Then start the engine and put the car in gear but not moving Then start the recording Give about 10 seconds at idle then start driving up to about 10 mph level off for a few seconds and then turn in a circle for about 10 seconds then straight again for as long as the parking lot will allow and come to a stop Then you can stop the recording Right now I don t think it is the power steering But when sitting still in gear with engine idling try to turn the steering wheel quickly If it is very hard to turn quickly but suddenly becomes easier to turn as you slow down the rate you are trying to turn it then it could be the power steering pump Also after you have driven the vehicle a few miles check the power steering hoses for heat If they are too hot to touch your rack is bad Specifically the pressure relief valve in the rack is bad It can cause the pump to make that noise but that is kinda rare \n",

      "My dealership finally figured out the cause with the  Forester battery problems They found internal short in the DCM Replaced the DCM and DCM battery There was internal failure within the DCM module found parasitic draw in System 14 SMP spec IS 035 0 70A found that the DCM was staying on and Deaw is 0 035 0 Parts replaced were SPO 86229SG000 PB001396 telematics and SPO 57433SG000 battery DCM It means that this DCM thing was zombie like and kept draining the life out of my battery info system when it should have shut down I was only charged 100 deductible on my extended warranty but since this problem has been ongoing for years and I paid for another battery last year I may contact national HQ for Subaru and see if they can make me whole I ve also had to take time off work for this problem This was some sort of defective part or programming from the start Hope everyone else will check out this possible solution for battery issues \n",

      "As an owner of a  Echo with 155K I want to speak up and say that the Echo is a GREAT car I always get well over 40 mpg on the highway and no less than 33 in complete city driving It has been SUPER reliable This car is a manual and I too taught my husband to drive stick on it We recently sold a used Fit and got a great price for it in part because we had a notebook showing every service AND a mileage notebook showing every single mpg per fill up We kept the Echo because we knew it would run a long time but we needed the cash generated from the Fit for our larger family car You could probably get a good amount selling your Honda because they hold value so well I agree with the others that does sound like a very high price did you check blue book My guess is that the Echo s owner sees it as worth so much because of its great mileage and reliability but you should be able to get them to come down on that price I fully expect to get another 100K out of this car When it finally dies I will probably get its newer sibling the Yaris As a side note the automatic Fit disappointed me in gas mileage but it s just because I am so spoiled by the Echo \n",

      " Honda Accord EX 4 Cyl 2 40 Hello everyone I have a older car with 200 000 miles on it I ve never really had any problems with it at all except that sometimes when I will be driving maybe once a month I ll be sitting at a light will let my foot off the gas to accelerate when it turns green and the car will act like it wants gas and is about to go but then dies shuts off stalls So I turn the car off put it in park and it always starts right back up Except this time it didn t start back up and I died at a intersection Towed it to a family auto chain shop here in Minnesota victory auto and they were nice and helpful but because it s a Friday they didn t have enough time to fully inspect Tried jumping it wouldn t crank over interesting because I never had trouble with it starting it always would and they tested the battery it was ok and had juice Lights work radio etc But it did make a click click sound but didn t want to turn over or hear the engine If it s my alternator do they really just go out like that They said it seems like the starter is bad which I thought is odd because it always starts up and because it won t start they can t test the alternator The quick fix is to put a new starter in and then can test other things They quoted me about 800 to do that which I wasn t expecting and do not know if is fair or right at all for my car So I started asking questions the best I could because that price set alarms off My oil change is due it s been over 10 000 miles I use synthetic but the level is fine and I ve noticed when I rarely am not top of changing it it s more likely to stall out like it did but it always starts up So if the battery is fine does the starter really go out like that It seems like it might be more progressive than just not working all of a sudden And if it is the starter and then the car starts and the battery is fine which in my head means the alternator is working otherwise the battery would likely be drained right what are your thoughts on what could be wrong And is 800 reasonable to put in a new starter and labor For an older car like this I m just skeptical if they re trying to pull a fast one on me I heard 800 and stopped What are some questions I can ask to verify I m not getting scammed I just know some places can start with one problem and move on to the next and soon enough you re in thousands of dollars whether it s legit or not However they were helpful and did try to explain and empathize and even loaned me a car They said they would look at other things for the weekend which I hope is a good sign I was want to be careful Thanks \n",

      " 165342 1 A clogged heater core car heat only works sometimes seemingly completely randomly as in it works some days and other days it blows cold air instead I m not even sure if a clogged heater core could cause overheating I have read very mixed answers online about that could someone also please clarify this On some engines such as the Chrysler 2 2 2 5 4 cylinder engines the heater core functions as the bypass flow when the thermostat is closed If the heater core is plugged it is necessary to drill a hole in the thermostat to provide some bypass flow  165342 2 A bad radiator Visually inspecting the current one it does have some bent fins and black stuff in some of the vents from visually inspecting it and generally looks dirty and not the silver metallic color a new one would be HOWEVER the mechanic said he flushed and tested it and the radiator to him appeared to have enough flow It is possible he made a mistake here though A decent aftermarket radiator costs less than 150 online with tax and shipping If in doubt I d replace In fact I always replace the radiator after 15 years or 150 000 miles since they lose efficiency and become plugged up with minerals etc Look for a good brand such as Denso First Time Fit rather than one of the no name brands that are cheaper  165342 Could a backwards thermostat cause overheating Absolutely The side which contains the wax pellet must be facing toward the hot coolant Otherwise the thermostat won t open until much later i e after the engine has already overheated \n",

      " transitional resistance This last time I worked on it in an attempt to lower this transitional resistance at the plugs to the PCM I jambed the tapered blade of a small pair of precision scissors into each metal receptacle in the plugs after determining that they were extruded and not rolled in an attempt to deform them from circles to ovals in order to get a tighter grip on the metals pins of the PCM that the plugs accept It was the only thing I could do without major surgery to get each wire out of the plug to check on the crimping of the wire to what I am referring to as receptacles It is possible to take the plugs apart but they are like Chinese puzzles You have to know how they are put together It may come to that if it continues to stall I know from experience that both the crimped connection between the wire and receptacle and the contact connection between the receptacle and the pin can be a source of resistance that is too great for the system to handle In one thread dealing with this very problem one guy said he went so far as to solder each individual wire to each individual pin in the PCM which had to be devilishly difficult I am detail oriented but not to that degree at least not any more Sadly it did not fix the problem This is a well documented problem with this model and vintage of Jeep I came to discover that many are having the same stalling problem with much later models of Jeep but that is theirs to enjoy not mine \n",

      "There are  reasons for this A defective condenser fan The cooling fan in the condenser is the first thing that you should look into while finding out the reason for car air conditioner not blowing cold air when idling If the fan is damaged or cannot run with its full force it cannot cool down the heat coming from the Freon refrigerant through the condenser When the car runs at a high speed the condenser does not require the fan for cooling the Freon because of sufficient air passing through it But when the car is not moving the fan is the only tool for making the Freon cold You should check if the fan s connections are loose or it does not properly sit in its slot Overheated engine Another common reason for a car AC not blowing cold air when idle is an overheated engine The compressor of the AC system moves heat from the radiator to the condenser When the car is already overheated and the fans in the radiator and condenser are not properly working for some reasons the system can t cool down the heat with the maximum efficiency Low level of Freon Low level of Freon is another probable reason The Freon gets used up with the running of the air conditioning When its level goes lower than the acceptable level you will face the issue of car air conditioner not blowing cold air when idling The compressor can pump the Freon more easily when the car is running at a high speed on the highway but it struggles when the car sits idle You can do the refill yourself if you know the procedure Debris If any foreign object or debris gets into the condenser and obstructs the fins the cooling process won t work properly especially when the car is idle These elements could also bend the cooling system and create the same effect You have to clean up the condenser fins and other areas to solve this problem \n",

      " I changed the gear oil thinking the transmission was sticking with 28 yr old dirty oil in it Doing maintenance as if it is a repair is an act of the desperate I recommend you get into the habit of changing the transmission oil every 30 000 miles or 60 000 miles if you can get synthetic gear oil in the right viscosity As for your problem I have a friend who drove without reverse for years Get into the habit of avoiding scenarios where you need to use reverse Find parking spaces where you can pull through so you don t have to back in or back out Save reverse for those rare occasions when you absolutely need it I used to occasionally have this issue with my old car One thing that helped was shifting into neutral letting out the clutch and pressing the clutch a second time It seemed to help synchronize things If that doesn t help move the car an inch or two as recommended above If you can find a good independent transmission rebuilder he might be able to replace the worn out gear at a reasonable price and also replace any other parts that have visible wear Whether it is worth the price is up to you and the overall condition of the rest of the car It doesn t hurt to call around and get some quotes for a manual transmission rebuild Manual transmissions aren t nearly as complicated as automatics \n",

      "On this Journey I found the battery would go dead after sitting for anywhere from overnight to  hours Customer noted that the battery had been replaced two months ago I replaced the alternator 1 month ago After slow charging the battery for 8 hours I went to work on a mission to track this down With an inferred temperature sensor I checked all the fuses but found none were really any warmer than the others I then connected a second battery to the charging posts with an AMP meter in series and then disconnected the positive post of the cars battery to direct all current load to the test battery With all electrical load in the off position I read the reading on the AMP meter The at rest reading was 0 055 amps Normal maximum allowable is 0 030 amps So while watching the amp meter I removed and installed one fuse after the other in sequence The reading changed minimally as I went through each fuse relay if at all The radio the Amplifier fuses had the largest effect but still quite minimal after ruling out those possibilities it was obvious the draw was not going through the power distribution center I searched for other wiring that was connected directly to the power cable At the positive feed wire I found an eyelet on the connection stud with a wire attached that ran into the cab I disconnected that wire and the amp reading dropped to 0 003 at rest well bellow maximum I found that wire was connected to a GPS tracking unit that had been installed by the previous owner I removed the GPS unit left the car connected the test battery I tested the cars battery after being charged for the 8 hours and found the CCA cold cranking amps rating to be at 550 amps I also felt the ends of the battery and found they felt slightly bulged At this point I left the car over night 10 hours with the positive cable still disconnected from the car battery In the morning I found the test battery was still at 12 80 volts the amp reading on the meter to still be at 0 003 Another test to the cars battery found the no load CCA had dropped overnight to 300 amps this indicates the car battery is weak The conclusion I came to was while the 0 055 amp draw was just above the normal allowable limit it was still too much for a weak battery to handle for long sitting periods The ultimate scenario likely was The GPS unit was constantly drawing the battery down while it was new causing it to need to be recharged This stressed out the alternator pushing it into early retirement With a weak alternator a constant overnight drain the battery was also weakened prematurely even after the alternator had been replaced the battery was no longer strong enough to withstand the prolonged draw of the GPS unit So this is the path that you will need to follow to try to find the draw on your battery An advisable step if you don t have the time or patience to follow this path would be to first look for any aftermarket installations and disconnect them for the normal amount of time it takes for your cars battery to be drained and see if it fixes it If there are none try this same thing by first pulling the IOD Ignition Off Draw fuse for that same period of time There are a few circuits controlled by the IOD fuse but if it stops the draw it gives you some place to start You can likely get a wiring diagram for the IOD loads from GOOGLE or your local parts supplier \n",

      " I strongly suspect that if one were to discover the truth about CVT failures one would find that the common denominator with the failed ones is lack of service  while I agree to this statement in general I think it is also brand dependent My own experience with Nissan CVT was that even when owning 2012 Altima from the new and with 30K fluid replacement regimen transmission started to slip and shudder after 90K miles then my wife s new 2013 Sentra CVT failed hard at 40K miles I can not speak to how bad it was on my daughter s 2007 Altima as we owned it from 68K miles it had on odometer yet even with regular fluid replacement it developed pre failure symptoms by 98K miles engine stall when braking hard shudder I would guess our family had some extreme bad luck with a sample of 3 Nissan CVTs out of 3 we owned showing it will not last long \n",

    "2. Train a classifier to make predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many models we could use to transform our post text into meaningful sentence embeddings. However, for our project we have chosen the BERT model due to high performance on unseen data as it's been trained on large corpuses of common texts and it's ability to handle dirty data due to its tokenisation architecture. More specifically, we will be using the [DistilBERT model](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/distilbert.html) from the HuggingFace transformer library.\n",
    "\n",
    "* DistilBERT processes the sentence and passes along some information it extracted from it on to the next model. DistilBERT is a smaller version of BERT developed and open sourced by the team at HuggingFace. It’s a lighter and faster version of BERT that roughly matches its performance.\n",
    "* We’ll be using [BertForSequenceClassification](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v2.2.0/model_doc/bert.html#bertforsequenceclassification). This is the normal BERT model with an added single linear layer on top for classification that we will use as a sentence classifier. As we feed input data, the entire pre-trained BERT model and the additional untrained classification layer is trained on our specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we pass between the two models is a vector of size 768 (The [CLS] vector). We can think of this of vector as an embedding for the sentence that we can use for classification. \n"

    "\n",
    "- For BERT, all sentences must be padded or truncated to a single, fixed length.\n",
    "The maximum sentence length is 512 tokens.\n",
    "- Padding is done with a special [PAD] token, which is at index 0 in the BERT vocabulary. The below illustration demonstrates padding out to a “MAX_LEN” of 8 tokens.\n",

    "<img src=\"http://www.mccormickml.com/assets/BERT/padding_and_mask.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The “Attention Mask” is simply an array of 1s and 0s indicating which tokens are padding and which aren’t (seems kind of redundant, doesn’t it?!). This mask tells the “Self-Attention” mechanism in BERT not to incorporate these PAD tokens into its interpretation of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the encoding task requires the following - \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split the sentence into tokens.\n",
    "2. Add the special [CLS] and [SEP] tokens.\n",
    "3. Pad or truncate all sentences to the same length.\n",
    "4. Create the attention masks which explicitly differentiate real tokens from [PAD] tokens.\n",
    "5. Map the tokens to their IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You should try implement the padding and attention masks yourself with matrix multiplication via numpy. It is trained on lower-cased English text. Hence we set the flag **do_lower_case** to true in BertTokenizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, the first four features are in `tokenizer.encode`, but you can also try use the `tokenizer.encode_plus` to get the fifth item (attention masks).
